1.  Create a new local repository-
    git init

2.  Add one or more files to staging-
    git add <filename>

3.  Commit changes to head (but not yet to the remote repository)-
    git commit -m "Commit Message"

4.  Commit any files you've added with git add, and also commit any files you've changed since then-
    git commit -a

5.  Send changes to the master branch of your remote repository-
    git push origin master

6.  List the files you've changed and those you still need to add or commit-
    git status

7.  If you haven't connected your local repository to a remote server, add the server to be able to push to it-
    git remote add origin <server>
